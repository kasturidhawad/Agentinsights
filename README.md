This report provides a recommendation for selecting a summarization model based on the average Rouge-L scores obtained from the 'rougeLsum_t5', 'rougeLsum_BERT', and 'rougeLsum_BART' columns. Rouge-L scores are commonly used to evaluate the quality of text summaries, with higher scores indicating better performance.

FINAL RECOMMENDATION REPORT:

Based on the provided Rouge-L scores, the following recommendation is made:

a) BART is recommended as the preferred summarization model. It achieved the highest average Rouge-L score of 0.3648, indicating that, on average, it generates summaries that are more similar to reference summaries. If the primary objective is to obtain high-quality summaries, BART is the top choice.

b) t5 is the second-best option with an average Rouge-L score of 0.3274. While not as high as BART, it still produces summaries with relatively strong Rouge-L scores.

c) BERT is not recommended based on the provided scores. It has the lowest average Rouge-L score of 0.1645, suggesting that its generated summaries are less similar to the reference summaries in the dataset.
